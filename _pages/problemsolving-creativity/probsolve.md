*   Explain some common roadblocks to effective problem solving

## Introduction

People face problems every day—usually, multiple problems throughout the day. Sometimes these problems are straightforward: To double a recipe, for example, you typically need only double each ingredient in the recipe. Sometimes, however, the problems we encounter are more complex. For example, say you have a work deadline, and you must mail a printed copy of a report to your supervisor by the end of the business day. The report is time-sensitive and must be sent overnight. You finished the report last night, but your printer will not work today. What should you do? First, you need to identify the problem and then apply a strategy for solving the problem.

The study of human and animal problem solving processes has provided much insight toward the understanding of our conscious experience and led to advancements in computer science and artificial intelligence. Essentially much of cognitive science today represents studies of how we consciously and unconsciously make decisions and solve problems. For instance, when encountered with a large amount of information, how do we go about making decisions about the most efficient way of sorting and analyzing all the information in order to find what you are looking for as in visual search paradigms in cognitive psychology. Or in a situation where a piece of machinery is not working properly, how do we go about organizing how to address the issue and understand what the cause of the problem might be. How do we sort the procedures that will be needed and focus attention on what is important in order to solve problems efficiently. Within this section we will discuss some of these issues and examine processes related to human, animal and computer problem solving.

## Problem-solving strategies

When people are presented with a problem—whether it is a complex mathematical problem or a broken printer, how do you solve it? Before finding a solution to the problem, the problem must first be clearly identified. After that, one of many problem solving strategies can be applied, hopefully resulting in a solution.

Problems themselves can be classified into two different categories known as *well-defined* and *ill-defined* problems (Pretz et al., 2003). Well-defined problems have specific goals, clearly defined solutions, and clear expected solutions; Ill-defined problems represent issues that do *not* have clear goals, solution paths, or expected solutions. Problem solving often incorporates logical reasoning and requires abstract thinking and creativity in order to find novel solutions. Processes relating to problem solving include problem finding (also known as problem analysis), problem shaping (where the organization of the problem occurs), generating alternative strategies, implementation of attempted solutions, and verification of the selected solution. 

A problem-solving strategy is a plan of action used to find a solution. Different strategies have different action plans associated with them (see, e.g., the table below). For example, a well-known strategy is trial and error. The old adage, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again” describes trial and error. In terms of your broken printer, you could try checking the ink levels, and if that doesn’t work, you could check to make sure the paper tray isn’t jammed. Or maybe the printer isn’t actually connected to your laptop. When using trial and error, you would continue to try different solutions until you solved your problem. Although trial and error is not typically one of the most time-efficient strategies, it is a commonly used one.

**Problem-Solving Strategies**

| Method      | Description | Example |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Trial and error      | Continue trying different solutions until problem is solved  | Restarting phone, turning off WiFi, turning off bluetooth in order to determine why your phone is malfunctioning |
| Algorithm   | Step-by-step problem-solving formula | Instruction manual for installing new software on your computer |
| Heuristic   | General problem-solving framework | Working backwards; breaking a task into steps  |

Another type of strategy is an algorithm. An algorithm is a problem-solving formula that provides you with step-by-step instructions used to achieve a desired outcome (Sternberg & Ben-Zeev, 2001). You can think of an algorithm as a recipe with highly detailed instructions that produce the same result every time they are performed. Algorithms are used frequently in our everyday lives, especially in computer science. When you run a search on the Internet, search engines like Google use algorithms to decide which entries will appear first in your list of results. Facebook also uses algorithms to decide which posts to display on your newsfeed. Can you identify other situations in which algorithms are used?

A heuristic is another type of problem solving strategy. While an algorithm must be followed exactly to produce a correct result, a heuristic is a general problem-solving framework (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). You can think of these as mental shortcuts that are used to solve problems. A “rule of thumb” is an example of a heuristic. Such a rule saves the person time and energy when making a decision, but despite its time-saving characteristics, it is not always the best method for making a rational decision. Different types of heuristics are used in different types of situations, but the impulse to use a heuristic occurs when one of five conditions is met (Pratkanis, 1989):

*   When one is faced with too much information
*   When the time to make a decision is limited
*   When the decision to be made is unimportant
*   When there is access to very little information to use in making the decision
*   When an appropriate heuristic happens to come to mind in the same moment

Working backwards is a useful heuristic in which you begin solving the problem by focusing on the end result. Consider this example: You live in Washington, D.C. and have been invited to a wedding at 4 PM on Saturday in Philadelphia. Knowing that I-95 tends to back up any day of the week, you need to plan your route and time your departure accordingly. If you want to be at the wedding service by 3:30 PM, and it takes 2.5 hours to get to Philadelphia without traffic, what time should you leave your house? You use the working backwards heuristic to plan the events of your day on a regular basis, probably without even thinking about it.

Another useful heuristic is the practice of accomplishing a large goal or task by breaking it into a series of smaller steps. Students often use this common method to complete a large research project or long essay for school. For example, students typically brainstorm, develop a thesis or main topic, research the chosen topic, organize their information into an outline, write a rough draft, revise and edit the rough draft, develop a final draft, organize the references list, and proofread their work before turning in the project. The large task becomes less overwhelming when it is broken down into a series of small steps.

Further problem solving strategies have been identified (listed below) that incorporate flexible and creative thinking in order to reach solutions efficiently.

### **Additional Problem Solving Strategies:**

*   **Abstraction** – refers to solving the problem within a model of the situation before applying it to reality.
*   **Analogy** – is using a solution that solves a similar problem.
*   **Brainstorming** – refers to collecting an analyzing a large amount of solutions, especially within a group of people, to combine the solutions and developing them until an optimal solution is reached.
*   **Divide and conquer** – breaking down large complex problems into smaller more manageable problems.
*   **Hypothesis testing** – method used in experimentation where an assumption about what would happen in response to manipulating an independent variable is made, and analysis of the affects of the manipulation are made and compared to the original hypothesis.
*   **Lateral thinking** – approaching problems indirectly and creatively by viewing the problem in a new and unusual light.
*   **Means-ends analysis** – choosing and analyzing an action at a series of smaller steps to move closer to the goal.
*   **Method of focal objects** – putting seemingly non-matching characteristics of different procedures together to make something new that will get you closer to the goal.
*   **Morphological analysis** – analyzing the outputs of and interactions of many pieces that together make up a whole system.
*   **Proof** – trying to prove that a problem cannot be solved. Where the proof fails becomes the starting point or solving the problem.
*   **Reduction** – adapting the problem to be as similar problems where a solution exists.
*   **Research** – using existing knowledge or solutions to similar problems to solve the problem.
*   **Root cause analysis** – trying to identify the cause of the problem.

The strategies listed above outline a short summary of methods we use in working toward solutions and also demonstrate how the mind works when being faced with barriers preventing goals to be reached.

One example of means-end analysis can be found by using the **Tower of Hanoi paradigm**. This paradigm can be modeled as a word problems as demonstrated by the **Missionary-Cannibal Problem**:

| **Missionary-Cannibal Problem** |
| :----------- | 
| _Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river and need to cross to the other side. The only means of crossing is a boat, and the boat can only hold two people at a time. Your goal is to devise a set of moves that will transport all six of the people across the river, being in mind the following constraint: The number of cannibals can never exceed the number of missionaries in any location. Remember that someone will have to also row that boat back across each time._ <br><br> **_Hint_:** At one point in your solution, you will have to send more people back to the original side than you just sent to the destination. |

| **Tower of Hanoi Problem** |
| :----------- | 
| The actual Tower of Hanoi problem consists of three rods sitting vertically on a base with a number of disks of different sizes that can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod obeying the following rules: |
| 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time. |
| 2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod. |
| 3. No disc may be placed on top of a smaller disk. |

### **_Figure 7.02._ Steps for solving the Tower of Hanoi in the minimum number of moves when there are 3 disks.**

With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2<sup>n</sup> – 1, where _n_ is the number of disks. For example, if there were 14 disks in the tower, the minimum amount of moves that could be made to solve the puzzle would be 2<sup>14</sup> – 1 = 16,383 moves. There are various ways of approaching the Tower of Hanoi or its related problems in addition to the approaches listed above including an iterative solution, recursive solution, non-recursive solution, a binary and gray code solutions, and graphical representations. An iterative solution entails moving the smallest pieces over one, then moving the next over one and if there is no tower position in the chosen direction you are moving to, move the pieces to the opposite end, but then continue to move in the same direction. By doing this you will complete the puzzle in the minimum amount of moves when there are 3 disks.Recursive solutions represents recognizing that the puzzle can be broken down into a series of sub problems to each of which the same general solving procedures apply, and then the total solution can be found by putting together the sub solutions. Non-recursive solutions entail recognizing that the procedures required to solve the problem have many regularities such as when counting the moves starting at 1, position of the disk in the series to be moved during move _m_ represents the number of times _m_ can be divided by 2 which indicates that every odd move involves the smallest disk. This allows for the following algorithm:1.) Move the smallest disk to the peg that it has not recently come from.2.) Move another disk legally (there will only be one possibility).A binary and gray solutions describe disk move numbers in binary notation (base-2) where there is only one binary digit (a bit) for each disk and the most significant (leftmost bit) represents the largest disk. A bit with a different value to the previous one means that the corresponding disk is one position to the left or right of the previous one.Graphical representations as their name describes represent visual presentations of conditions that can be modeled in order to view the most efficient and effective solutions. A common graph for the Tower of Hanoi is represented by a unidirectional, pyramid shaped graph, where different nodes (pieces within each level of the graph) represent distributions of disks and the edges represent moves.

### **_Figure 7.03._ Graphical representation of nodes (circles) and moves (lines) of Tower of Hanoi.**

The Tower of Hanoi is a frequently used psychological technique to study problem solving and procedure analysis. A variation of the Tower of Hanoi known as the Tower of London has been developed which has been an important tool in the neuropsychological diagnosis of executive function disorders and their treatment.

### **Solving Puzzles**

Problem-solving abilities can improve with practice. Many people challenge themselves every day with puzzles and other mental exercises to sharpen their problem-solving skills. Sudoku puzzles appear daily in most newspapers. Typically, a sudoku puzzle is a 9×9 grid. The simple sudoku below (see figure) is a 4×4 grid. To solve the puzzle, fill in the empty boxes with a single digit: 1, 2, 3, or 4. Here are the rules: The numbers must total 10 in each bolded box, each row, and each column; however, each digit can only appear once in a bolded box, row, and column. Time yourself as you solve this puzzle and compare your time with a classmate.

### ![A four column by four row Sudoku puzzle is shown. The top left cell contains the number 3. The top right cell contains the number 2. The bottom right cell contains the number 1. The bottom left cell contains the number 4. The cell at the intersection of the second row and the second column contains the number 4. The cell to the right of that contains the number 1. The cell below the cell containing the number 1 contains the number 2. The cell to the left of the cell containing the number 2 contains the number 3.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/microsite-cuny-prod/media/courseware/openstax/m49057/CNX_Psych_07_03_Sudoko.jpg)

### **How long did it take you to solve this sudoku puzzle? (You can see the answer at the end of this section.)**  

Here is another popular type of puzzle (figure below) that challenges your spatial reasoning skills. Connect all nine dots with four connecting straight lines without lifting your pencil from the paper:

### ![A square shaped outline contains three rows and three columns of dots with equal space between them.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/microsite-cuny-prod/media/courseware/openstax/m49057/CNX_Psych_07_03_DotsAndLines.jpg)

### **Did you figure it out? (The answer is at the end of this section.) Once you understand how to crack this puzzle, you won’t forget.**  

Take a look at the “Puzzling Scales” logic puzzle below (figure below). Sam Loyd, a well-known puzzle master, created and refined countless puzzles throughout his lifetime (Lloyd, 1914).

![A puzzle involving a scale is shown. At the top of the figure it reads: “Sam Loyds Puzzling Scales.” The first row of the puzzle shows a balanced scale with 3 blocks and a top on the left and 12 marbles on the right. Below this row it reads: “Since the scales now balance.” The next row of the puzzle shows a balanced scale with just the top on the left, and 1 block and 8 marbles on the right. Below this row it reads: “And balance when arranged this way.” The third row shows an unbalanced scale with the top on the left side, which is much lower than the right side. The right side is empty. Below this row it reads: “Then how many marbles will it require to balance with that top?”](https://s3.amazonaws.com/microsite-cuny-prod/media/courseware/openstax/m49057/CNX_Psych_07_03_SamLoyd.jpg)

### **What steps did you take to solve this puzzle?** **You can read the solution at the end of this section.**  

### **PITFALLS TO PROBLEM SOLVING**

Not all problems are successfully solved, however. What challenges stop us from successfully solving a problem? Albert Einstein once said, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.” Imagine a person in a room that has four doorways. One doorway that has always been open in the past is now locked. The person, accustomed to exiting the room by that particular doorway, keeps trying to get out through the same doorway even though the other three doorways are open. The person is stuck—but she just needs to go to another doorway, instead of trying to get out through the locked doorway. A mental set is where you persist in approaching a problem in a way that has worked in the past but is clearly not working now.

Functional fixedness is a type of mental set where you cannot perceive an object being used for something other than what it was designed for. During the _Apollo 13_ mission to the moon, NASA engineers at Mission Control had to overcome functional fixedness to save the lives of the astronauts aboard the spacecraft. An explosion in a module of the spacecraft damaged multiple systems. The astronauts were in danger of being poisoned by rising levels of carbon dioxide because of problems with the carbon dioxide filters. The engineers found a way for the astronauts to use spare plastic bags, tape, and air hoses to create a makeshift air filter, which saved the lives of the astronauts.

An example of trying to overcome functional fixedness in _Apollo 13_:

<br />

Researchers have investigated whether functional fixedness is affected by culture. In one experiment, individuals from the Shuar group in Ecuador were asked to use an object for a purpose other than that for which the object was originally intended. For example, the participants were told a story about a bear and a rabbit that were separated by a river and asked to select among various objects, including a spoon, a cup, erasers, and so on, to help the animals. The spoon was the only object long enough to span the imaginary river, but if the spoon was presented in a way that reflected its normal usage, it took participants longer to choose the spoon to solve the problem. (German & Barrett, 2005). The researchers wanted to know if exposure to highly specialized tools, as occurs with individuals in industrialized nations, affects their ability to transcend functional fixedness. It was determined that functional fixedness is experienced in both industrialized and nonindustrialized cultures (German & Barrett, 2005).

In order to make good decisions, we use our knowledge and our reasoning. Often, this knowledge and reasoning is sound and solid. Sometimes, however, we are swayed by biases or by others manipulating a situation. We'll return to some of these issues in our next topic on decision making. 

Were you able to determine how many marbles are needed to balance the scales in the figure below? You need nine. Were you able to solve the problems in the figures above? Here are the answers.

![The first puzzle is a Sudoku grid of 16 squares (4 rows of 4 squares) is shown. Half of the numbers were supplied to start the puzzle and are colored blue, and half have been filled in as the puzzle’s solution and are colored red. The numbers in each row of the grid, left to right, are as follows. Row 1: blue 3, red 1, red 4, blue 2. Row 2: red 2, blue 4, blue 1, red 3. Row 3: red 1, blue 3, blue 2, red 4. Row 4: blue 4, red 2, red 3, blue 1.The second puzzle consists of 9 dots arranged in 3 rows of 3 inside of a square. The solution, four straight lines made without lifting the pencil, is shown in a red line with arrows indicating the direction of movement. In order to solve the puzzle, the lines must extend beyond the borders of the box. The four connecting lines are drawn as follows. Line 1 begins at the top left dot, proceeds through the middle and right dots of the top row, and extends to the right beyond the border of the square. Line 2 extends from the end of line 1, through the right dot of the horizontally centered row, through the middle dot of the bottom row, and beyond the square’s border ending in the space beneath the left dot of the bottom row. Line 3 extends from the end of line 2 upwards through the left dots of the bottom, middle, and top rows. Line 4 extends from the end of line 3 through the middle dot in the middle row and ends at the right dot of the bottom row.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/microsite-cuny-prod/media/courseware/openstax/m49057/CNX_Psych_07_06_Solutions.jpg)

### SUMMARY

Many different strategies exist for solving problems. Typical strategies include trial and error, applying algorithms, and using heuristics. To solve a large, complicated problem, it often helps to break the problem into smaller steps that can be accomplished individually, leading to an overall solution. Roadblocks to problem solving include a mental set, functional fixedness, and various biases that can cloud decision making skills.
